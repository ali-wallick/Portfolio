<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Ali. I'm a gal passionate about developing games. My favorite aspects are programming and all-around design. I currently work as a Engineer at <a href="http://seconddinner.com/" target="_blank">Second Dinner</a>, creating mobile games in the Unity engine. I also enjoy designing and programming personal games with my friends on the side!</p>
