<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Ali. I'm a gal passionate about developing games. My favorite aspects are programming (especially UI) and all-around design. I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.mobilityware.com/" target="_blank">MobilityWare</a>, creating mobile games in Unity 3D. I also enjoy designing and programming personal games with my friends on the side!</p>

<p>On this site you can find my <a href="/blog">Blog</a> with updates on the projects I'm working on and various other activities.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="/projects/">Projects page</a> for listings about my current and past projects by type and date.</p>

<p>Some of my basic info can be found on the Quick Info bar to the right. You can learn a bit more about me on the <a href="/about">About page</a> and download my Resumé on the <a href="/resume">Resumé page</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy and feel free to send any feedback to my email on the right.</p>
