<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Ali. I'm a gal passionate about developing games. My favorite aspects are programming (especially UI) and all-around design. I currently work as a UI Programmer at <a href="http://www.red5studios.com/" target="_blank">Red 5 Studios</a>, helping to create menus and HUDs for the MMO RPG/FPS <i>Firefall</i>. I also enjoy designing and programming personal games with my friends on the side!</p>
