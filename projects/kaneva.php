<h2>About</h2>

<p><img class="imgRight" style="width:35%" src="/resources/images/projects/kaneva/screenshot2.png" />The World of Kaneva is a social virtual world and game platform. In it, players can do everything from creating an avatar and socializing, to using and creating their user-generated content, to building massive worlds with integrated scripting.</p>

<p>I began Kaneva as a Technical Support Engineer, and helped players with their scripting, as well as creating game templates for players to utilize. However, I quickly found a niche in UI programming and was moved to work full time with the game's user interface system.</p>

<p>Over my four years at Kaneva, I became the Lead UI Programmer, working on almost every menu in the game - from collaboration on design, to construction of the menu based on the artist's comps, to programming their functionality. I worked with the company's in-house menu development system that's scripted in Lua. Frequently, I collaborated with the game engine and web development teams to complete projects.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>During my time at Kaneva, I created menus including:
    <ul><img class="imgRight" style="width:50%" src="/resources/images/projects/kaneva/screenshot3.png"
 />
        <li><strong>HUD:</strong> Player HUD and Build/Creator HUD menus</li>
        <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Player inventory and storage/bank menus</li>
        <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Browsing various user-created worlds</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Displays user-created events and allows players to travel to them</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Object Menus:</strong> Visual property editor for the scripted objects</li>
        <li><strong>Media Select Menus:</strong> Allows users to change videos and flash widgets on various special in-game objects</li>
        <li><strong>Player and Object Context Menus:</strong> Displays information and action options on right clicking people and objects</li>
        <li><strong>Welcome and Builder Tutorials</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bug fixes, optimizations, and tweaks for many more</strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>One of my favorite projects at Kaneva was a animation system I created after being frustrated at having to hand-code any animation. It ended up being used by both the UI and game teams!</p>

<p>Additionally, I have worked in the past to create game templates such as Treasure Hunt and Adventure, where players can easily create a small treasure hunt or adventure game by dropping items and creating various "levels" to explore.</p>
